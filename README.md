django based project
It is project developed using django .In this i made a website for banking in which there is portal for admin , employee and customer for login and logout in which session authentication is used and there is feature to modify there account settings like changing password ,mysql is used as a database manager and in the customer account i have included a pin lock to open their bank locker and connected it using raspberry pie for IoT purpose and used pubnub as a server.
I am thinking to add transaction mode so that every customer. In that the main problem arises is that when multiple payment is commited at same time which one to do first .
looking forward for suggestions.
